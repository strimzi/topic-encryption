# vertx-proxy

This component implements a minimal Kafka proxy providing a runtime context for development and testing of the [topic encryption module](../encmod). The proxy implementation is currently  considered experimental and subject to change. As the name reveals, the [vert.x framework](https://vertx.io/) has been used as the foundation for this proxy.
